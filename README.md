# Simple To-Do List Web Application (produced by Google Gemini)

This is a basic to-do list web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed (by toggling a strikethrough), and remove them from the list. The to-do list is also persisted in the browser's local storage, so your tasks will be saved even if you close and reopen the page.

## Features

* **Add Tasks:** Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button (or press Enter) to add it to the list.
* **Mark as Completed:** Click on a task item to toggle its completion status (a strikethrough will appear/disappear).
* **Remove Tasks:** Click the "Remove" button next to a task to delete it from the list.
* **Local Storage:** Your to-do list is saved in your browser's local storage, so it persists across sessions.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Provides the basic structure and elements of the web page.
* **CSS:** Styles the visual appearance of the to-do list, making it user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
* **JavaScript:** Handles the dynamic behavior of the application, including adding, marking as complete, and removing tasks, as well as interacting with local storage.

## Setup and Usage

1.  **Clone the Repository (Optional):** If you have the code in a repository (e.g., on GitHub), you can clone it to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The to-do list application will load.

3.  **Adding Tasks:**
    * Type your task into the input field labeled "Enter your text here...".
    * Click the "Add" button or press the Enter key. The task will be added to the list below.

4.  **Marking as Completed:**
    * Click on the text of a to-do item in the list. This will toggle a strikethrough, visually indicating that the task is completed. Click again to remove the strikethrough.

5.  **Removing Tasks:**
    * Each to-do item has a "Remove" button next to it. Click this button to permanently delete the task from the list and local storage.
